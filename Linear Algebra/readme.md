**1-Linear Algebra :**
- The study of **structures** is where you start taking numbers and putting them into equations in the form of variables.
- **Algebra** contains the rules of how you the manipulate these equations.
- Here you will also find vectors and matrices which are multi-dimensional numbers, and the rules of how they relate to each other are captured in **linear algebra.**


**2-Linear Algebra & ML :** 
Linear algebra is foundational in machine learning, covering concepts such as vectors, matrices, linear transformations, systems of equations, and determinants. It provides a deeper understanding of how data manipulation, especially in neural networks, relies heavily on matrix operations.
