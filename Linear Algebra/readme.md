**1-Linear Algebra & ML :** 

Linear algebra is foundational in machine learning, covering concepts such as vectors, matrices, linear transformations, systems of equations, and determinants. It provides a deeper understanding of how data manipulation, especially in neural networks, relies heavily on matrix operations.


**2-Algebra :**

- The study of **structures** is where you start taking numbers and putting them into equations in the form of variables.
- **Algebra** contains the rules of how you the manipulate these equations.
-  vectors and matrices  are multi-dimensional numbers, and the rules of how they relate to each other are captured in **linear algebra.**
  
  
  **3-Linearity :**

- **Linearity** :a function or operation is considered linear if it satisfies two key properties:
  
    - Additivity : f(x+y)=f(x)+f(y)f(x+y)=f(x)+f(y)
          - In practical terms, the function treats additions in the input space and output space in a straightforward                way. This can represent situations where combining two inputs produces a combined effect in the output.
          - Preservation of Zero This property is a consequence of additivity. It means that the function doesn't                    introduce a "shift" or translation in the data; it keeps the origin fixed
    - Homogeneity : f(cx)=cf(x)f(cx)=cf(x)
          -If you double the input vector, the output vector will also be doubled. This property reflects                           proportionality and uniformity in how the function responds to changes in the input.

In various applications, linearity simplifies mathematical analysis and computations. It allows for the use of powerful tools from linear algebra and facilitates the understanding of how the function responds to different inputs. Linear functions are prevalent in physics, engineering, economics, and other fields where proportional relationships and additive effects are significant.

**Linear Relationship:**
Imagine you have a jar of candies. Your friend gives you 3 candies every day. 
-If you want to know how many candies you'll have after 5 days, you can just multiply the number of candies you get each day (3) by the number of days (5): 3×5=153×5=15. So, you'll have 15 candies after 5 days. 
-If your friend gives you 2 more candies each day, you can find out how many candies you'll have after 3 more days by adding 2×3=62×3=6. The total candies you'll have is the sum of the candies you get each day.

**Non-linear Relationship:**
Imagine you have a garden, and you plant some sunflower seeds. Every day, the height of the sunflowers doesn't just add a fixed amount; it grows in a special way. Let's say each day the sunflowers grow 10% taller than the previous day.
-If the sunflowers start at 20 centimeters, after one day, they would grow to 20+20×0.10=20+2=2220+20×0.10=20+2=22 centimeters. After another day, they would grow to 22+22×0.10=22+2.2=24.222+22×0.10=22+2.2=24.2 centimeters.
The growth keeps getting a bit faster each day.

This is an example of non-linear growth because the increase each day isn't a fixed amount;the flowers grow in a special way, and the more they grow, the faster they grow!
