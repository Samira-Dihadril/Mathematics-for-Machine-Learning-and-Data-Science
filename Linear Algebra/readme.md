**1-Linear Algebra :**

- The study of **structures** is where you start taking numbers and putting them into equations in the form of variables.
- **Algebra** contains the rules of how you the manipulate these equations.
-  vectors and matrices  are multi-dimensional numbers, and the rules of how they relate to each other are captured in **linear algebra.**
- **Linearity** : a function or operation is considered linear if it satisfies two key properties: 
    Additivity : f(x+y)=f(x)+f(y)f(x+y)=f(x)+f(y)
    Homogeneity : f(cx)=cf(x)f(cx)=cf(x)


**2-Linear Algebra & ML :** 

Linear algebra is foundational in machine learning, covering concepts such as vectors, matrices, linear transformations, systems of equations, and determinants. It provides a deeper understanding of how data manipulation, especially in neural networks, relies heavily on matrix operations.
